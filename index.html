                The project was to pick a function of a existing LMS and improve on that function.
                We chose to work on the discussion board as it was lacking in many features that
                would make it much better.

                    Our version of the project the project plans to reinvent the UI for the website,
                    and we wanted to add functionality to the discussion board that made it more like 
                    a forum that a website.
