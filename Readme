TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT

1. ensure you have nodejs installed
    you can test by running node --version

2. cd to repo in terminal of choice
3. run 'npm i'
    this will install the dependencies
4. To start the server run 'node ./index.js'
    You should see console output with a link to the live site. Go to that URL.
5. The prototype is now running.

** You only need to run 'npm i' the FIRST time you clone the repo. After that, to run the prototype you ONLY NEED TO RUN 'node ./index.js'
